## Our Game

Meet Metushelach, (AKA "Met"), your character.

After suddenly dying due to an accident, and due to a rather sketchy past, Met has made it into hell. Though, Met gets into a beef with no other than the Devil himself, which puts Met into trial.

In this **"נהפוך הוא"** theme'd platformer game, your goal is not to stay alive.
This time, your goal is to Die. Hard. As much as possible, in whichever way possible.
